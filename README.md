# 1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?

I would fit my automated tests in as a Github actions that runs whenever code is pushed. 
I think that this would be the best option because this ensures that tests are being run often.
Also, the tests would run automatically so there is less room for error or forgetfulness.
It would also help be able to use branch protections such as prevent a merge unless the tests pass.

# 2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output?

No. This would be better handled by a unit test.
